# Numerical Analysis of Gravitational Lensing.

Investigating the behaviour of particle-natured light in the vicinity of Nmassive objects, and subsequent consequences on Gravitational Lens-ing.It is known that the motion of two bodies under their mutual Grav-itational Interaction can be analyzed and solved analytically.  When a3rd body is added to this system, no such analytical solution exists.In this project, we have attempted at demonstrating the behaviourof light around super-massive celestial objects like a black-hole.  This demonstration combines the use of Physical Laws, approximations tothe objects in the problem and the numerical methods to analyze mo-tion of the objects

The scripts are written in VPython. It is recommended to run them on https://glowscript.org.
