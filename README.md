# MA2O2-Course-Project
This repository contains the source files for the MA202 Course Project. The scripts are written in VPython. It is recommended to run them on https://glowscript.org/ .
I cannot thank https://github.com/plugyawn enough, without which this wouldn't have happened on time.
Cheers.
